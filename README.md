Hello! I am Johnny Cappetta, a 23 year old/recent Purdue University mechanical engineer graduate turned software engineer. Throughout college, I was unsure what I wanted to do with my life, so I picked one of the most versatile engineering degrees, mechanical engineering. With the guidance of friends and family, I became interested in software engineering and programming. 

I am excited to see what software has in store for me.
I am currently working for JPMorgan Chase as a software engineer in their Tech Connect program. I am looking forward to learning more about frontend/backend that will hopefully guide my career path. 

I will be adding to Git throughout my career as I take on new and meaningful challenges and projects.
